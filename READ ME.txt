This is a prototype/example of a tutorial I followed for Pygame, Although you can make pretty amazing games in Pygame, I would not recommend it.

Reason being that Pygame is really complicated and acts as its own Syntax by expanding Pythons library to include things such as fps delay, key/mouse detection and more

Thank you to Tech with Tim for his tutorial on Pygame, otherwise I would've been stuck not knowing what to do.

TO PLAY:

1. Press the 'PLAY' button on the VSCode Window

CONTROLS:
A to move right, D to move left.
W to jump.
SPACE to shoot a projectile.

WHEN YOU ARE DONE PLAYING/TESTING:

Press the "X" button on the Pygame Window, otherwise the game will not work because the Enemy
Character doesn't re-render onto the Window.
